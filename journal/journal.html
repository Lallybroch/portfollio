          freedom.<br />I would like to digitalize my journal and my portfolio
          since Im currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br />I would
          like to get an internship at a tech company as a software engineer<br />My
          life goal is to work at Google<br />I',m confident with Python but I
          would love to learn some other languages.
